# Probability theory
### Repository with code for simulating experiments to solve university problems in probability theory.
## Discrete distribution - uniform distribution
The program simulates dice rolls with equally likely sides falling out from 1 to 6 and displays statistics: the number of certain sides falling out and the calculated probability of each side falling out
## Continuous distribution - Gamma-distribution
